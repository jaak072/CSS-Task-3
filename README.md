This project given by CampusX mentorship program and done by me(Jawed).
In that project , make a page like that image in below use 2 navigation bar 
One has scrollable but 2nd wasn't. And the 3rd part is so interesting creating a 
Box in which we register and register button below the registration box.
I'm enjoying to make it .tq.
